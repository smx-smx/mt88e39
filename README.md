# mt88e39
MT88E39 Caller ID Driver for Linux

This is a proof of concept driver developed for the Raspberry PI back in 2015.
It communicates with the MT88E39 through GPIO.

Interrupts are used to handle the 3 events generated by the device:

| name              | description | action |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| DRDY (Data Ready) | Signals the end of a byte | queue the byte in the buffer |
| DCLK (Data Clock) | Signals a bit is available on the Data pin | probe the data pin and append the bit into the current byte |
| CD (Carrier Detect) | Signals an inbound call | reset the state, prepare to read the data |

The driver creates a character device, `/dev/mt88e39`, that will yield the last received buffer when read.
